**Installation**
pip install git+git://github.com/Tarokan/aiocouchdb 

CouchDB client built on top of `aiohttp`_ and made for `asyncio`_.

Current status: **beta**. `aiocouchdb` has all CouchDB API implements up to
1.6.1 release, and the ability to use Mongo Queries.

However, it may lack of some usability and stability bits, but
work is in progress. Feel free to `send pull request`_ or `open issue`_ if
you'd found something that should be fixed.

**Feature**

- Modern CouchDB client for Python 3.3+ based on `aiohttp`_
- Complete CouchDB API support (JSON and Multipart) up to 1.6.1 version
- Multiuser workflow with Basic Auth, Cookie, Proxy and OAuth support
- Stateless behavior
